# TODO list


## 1. Generate data

define d-dim ODE system (initial value, parameter, total time, total steps for observation);

solve ODE with Scipy;

plot 2D/3D trajectory/Phase diagram;

plot curve of (t, x_i), and (x_i, x_j) 2-dim obits;

plot scatter diagram (maybe with noise), and save noise data;


## 2. Fitting derivative function

define a continuous kernel function

define two functions for constructing Gram matrix and data-adaptive basis functions

compute coefficient vector and values of data-adaptive functions 


## 3. improve efficiency w.r.t. numerical integration
